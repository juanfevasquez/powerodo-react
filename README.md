# Powerodo

Powerodo is a collaborative app to help you increase focus and productivity by using the pomodoro technique.

## How this app is built

- A11y first approach: From the very first mockup, the app has to comply with web accessibility standards.  The html must be semantic and the architecture must enable users to navigate and interact with every aspect of the app by using the keyboard only and to offer a great experience for users that rely on screen readers.
- Mobile first: The app will be built thinking on its usability for small screens and progressively adapt the layout for bigger screens.
- PWA: The app will enable all of its capabilities offline when pomodoro is to be done solo.  Statistics of pomodoros done solo will be uploaded once the app is online.
